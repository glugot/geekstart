As mentioned previously, Geek Start is a community blog where anyone, who is a
member of GLUGOT can add their articles which will go through a review process
and gets added to [http://geekstart.tce.edu/][9]

 1. Think about an interesting article

Step 6 - Preview Article
------------------------
Once you are done with editing your article, you can preview it by issuing the 
following command in your local clone of Geek Start repository:

          $ make html

The above command will create the html files along with the article you added 
in the *output* folder in the current directory. Use a web browser to view the 
website, for example:

         $ firefox /home/stylesen/geekstart/output/index.html

The article which you added should appear in the web browser. You can make 
sure if the alignment, look and feel are good.

Step 7 - Pull Request
---------------------
When you are satisfied editing and previewing your article, send a pull 
request for the editors to review your article. Take a look at 
[https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/][11]

Step 8 - Editor Reviews
-----------------------
The pull request created in Step 7 will be examined by a reviewer who are part 
of the GLUGOT community. They will look for the following,

 * Does the article consist of any offensive material?
 * Is the article content plagiarised from some other material?
 * Improvements if any?

Depending on the above if there are no comments, your article will be merged 
to the main Geek Start repository and eventually will get published to 
[http://geekstart.tce.edu/][9]. If there are comments, then the reviewer will 
communicate the same using GitHub review mechanism which will be intimated to 
you via an email registered as part of your GitHub account.
