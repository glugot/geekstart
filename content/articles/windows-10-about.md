Summary: Information about Windows 10

>Great new Start menu, with Cortana, Windows Hello, Continuum and Edge browser, Microsoft rolls out its exotic Windows 10.

## Want it?

Well.. there are *three ways* actually!

1. You must have been a part of the Windows Insider program and should have installed the preview version before July 29th, after which you continue to get builds and free software. This doesn't require you to have previous versions of Windows or to buy either. A Likely loophole if you had the opportunity.

2. Update your existing Windows 7/8/8.1 to the latest releases and look out for the system tray to notify you with a Windows 10 icon. Reserve your download by clicking it. Sit back and relax you'll be notified about your Windows 10 copy within a week to 10 days.

3. Buy a new pc or tablet with Windows 10 preloaded.

## Things that you'll tag 'not cool'

 Apart from interesting features, we have to look out for a few else cases too...
 Automatic Updates are given no control to turn off. Once there's an update to the OS you *must* run it.
 RIP Media Centre, Desktop Gadgets and the traditional Hearts game. They are no more with us.

Microsoft employs Windows Update Delivery Optmization(WUDO): a torrent style approach to receive software updates that allows Windows 10 users to download updates from other users. This is done with a view to handle to multiple downloads that can be difficult for the company. This is perfectly good for the company but results in unnecessary bandwidth utilisation and will cost you more.

### Dont want the WUDO feature?

> 1. Go to **Settings** from the Start menu

> 2. Search for **Update and Security**

> 3. Under **Windows Update**, search and open *Advanced Options*

> 4. Under **Choose How Updates are Installed**, select **Choose how updates are delivered**

> 5. Disable the toggle under **Updated from More than One Place**
